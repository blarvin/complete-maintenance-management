# Plan Structure: Project Context Management Section

When creating implementation plans (`.plan.md` files), include a **"Project Context Management"** section at the end with these steps:

## Required Final Steps in Every Plan

### 1. User Verification

- List specific verification steps for the user to confirm the implementation works

### 2. ISSUES.md

- Mark off completed work items related to the feature

### 3. IMPLEMENTATION.md (if applicable)

- Add notes for architectural decisions or unusual patterns
- Skip for straightforward implementations

### 4. LATER.md

- Add deferred work identified during implementation
- Include related features intentionally out of scope
- Note any technical debt or cleanup opportunities discovered

## Example Section

```markdown
## Project Context Management

After verification is complete, update project documentation:

1. **ISSUES.md** - Mark off completed work items
2. **IMPLEMENTATION.md** - [Add notes if architectural, or "N/A - straightforward implementation"]
3. **LATER.md** - Add deferred items:
   - [List specific deferred items here]
```

This ensures plans include the full workflow from implementation through documentation updates.
