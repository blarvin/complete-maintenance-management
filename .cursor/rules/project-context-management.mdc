# Plan Structure: Project Context Management Section

When creating implementation plans (`.plan.md` files), include a **"Project Context Management"** section at the end with these steps:

## Required Final Steps in Every Plan

### 1. User Verification
- List specific verification steps for the user to confirm the implementation works
- After the coding work is believed to be complete, ask the user to verify the implementation works.
- IMPORTANT: If, and only if, the user confirms the implementation works, then move to the steps below regarding updating the project documentation.

### 2. ISSUES.md
- If the user has confirmed the implementation works, then mark off the work items related to the feature.

### 3. IMPLEMENTATION.md (if applicable)
- If the user has confirmed the implementation works, then add notes for architectural decisions or unusual patterns.
- Skip for straightforward implementations

### 4. LATER.md
- If the user has confirmed the implementation works, then add deferred work identified during implementation.
- Include related features intentionally out of scope
- Note any technical debt or cleanup opportunities discovered

## Example Section

```markdown
## Project Context Management

After verification is complete, update project documentation:

1. **ISSUES.md** - Mark off completed work items
2. **IMPLEMENTATION.md** - [Add notes if architectural work was done or unusual patterns were used]
3. **LATER.md** - Add deferred items:
   - [List specific deferred items here]
```

This ensures plans include the full workflow from implementation through documentation updates.
